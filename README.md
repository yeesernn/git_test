Yee Sern's first project on testing out the functionality of Git.
Learning the ins and outs of Git.

Initial creation on 2019, now continuing on 2023.

Issue: 
1. Need to rename the branch from MASTER to MAIN - DONE
2. In GitHub repo renaming there, after I renamed, got messages like what protect branch etc? What are those?
